    <p>I have an issue. I like to write. I like the act of writing and the meditative state that can sometimes be brought on. It&rsquo;s very refreshing and satisfying to see words created by my own mind, my thoughts and ideas, written down on a page, or tablet. Typing just doesn&rsquo;t have the same level of cathartic release. At least, not for me.</p>
<p>Within the inane ramblings and deepest desires are carefully curated words that may never be read by another human for as long as I live. The drifting of the pen, back and forth, in a style that&rsquo;s as unique as a fingerprint, creating an almost illegible imprint only accessible by those with the language. And even then, it can be difficult.</p>
<p>Herein lies the issue, if a persons handwriting can be described as hieroglyphic, so much so that others can&rsquo;t even read it, have they even conveyed any meaning? In the same vein, if a person writes without intention, is it worthy of another persons time? For me, this takes away a lot of the enjoyment of writing, as I&rsquo;m constantly worried about whether or not what I have to say holds any meaning to anyone but myself. Not that the opinions of others should get in the wary of my, or anyone else’s, enjoyment. But that&rsquo;s easier said then done.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as I&rsquo;m writing this out on my tablet, something I haven&rsquo;t done in a long time, the thoughts I&rsquo;m capturing feel worthwhile and are words I&rsquo;m happy to share into the void. Although, I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s very wise to post an image of my handwriting on the internet for eternity, so I won’t.</p>
