**Our solar system has a wall**. The heliopause – the region of space in which solar wind isn’t hot enough to push back the wind of particles coming from distant stars – it is often considered the “boundary wall” of the Solar System and interstellar space.

The heliopause is a theoretical boundary where the Sun’s wind is stopped by the interstellar medium. This is the boundary where the interstellar medium and solar wind pressures balance.

Like an egg. We live in an egg.
