title = 'Incredible Sickness'

Itâ€™s always during a period of incredible sickness, one in which the mind and
senses are dulled almost to the point of no return, the body conveniently forgetting how to perform basic functions. It is in those times, a disconnect occurs.
Then, for the length of the illness, the body and mind fight each other to once again find equilibrium. The intervening period is one of separated growth with the psyche lagging behind, steadily coiling itself like an ancient biological motor to be released once the body has the capacity to handle it again. Such a strange feeling. A very difficult one to convey. That initial breakthrough of inertia provides energy in abundance, however, it is always short lived. As though the organism's natural state must be maintained and any divergence is tenuous at best. Is there a finite amount of times this process can be endured? A better question, perhaps, is how do others experience this phenomenon, are the outcomes the same?
